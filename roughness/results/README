  variable_grid_roughness.mat

Description:
  This contains std(z'), mean cell depth, and the lat/lon coordinates for 22 grids ranging from 10m to 1500m horizontal resolution over the Asilomar Beach
  and China Rock high resolution bathymetry. Grids were derived from the 100m model grid created by Dr. Suanda and Dr. Ramierez. Figures showing std(z') 
  for all grid resolutions included here can be found in ROXSI/figures/variable_grid_roughness.

Variables:
1. G10rgh     
     .
     .
  G1500rgh (2d array) : std(z') for different grids where the resolution is an integer following G. These were calculated for each cell using 
                         get_cell_roughness() in cell_roughness.py.

2. G10h
    .
    .
  G1500h (2d array) : mean depth of grid cells.

3. G10_lat / G10_lon
    .
    .
  G1500_lat / G1500_lon (2d array) : Coordinates of grid cell verticies.
