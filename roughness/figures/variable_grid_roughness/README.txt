This folder contains figures created with variable_grid_rgh.ipynb. These show sigma(z') within grid cells of different resolution using the China Rock and Asilomar
Beach bathymetry. G100m desognated 100m horizontal resolution. Grid cells must have at least 25% bathymetry coverage to be assigned a roughness value.
