## Functions
* NC_NeilsonDiss.m - determines the theoretical energy dissipations at each time and at each frequency by using the energy dissipation factors from Neilson's 1992 method from "Spectral wave dissipatino over a barrier reef" by Lowe.
* NC_ObsDiss.m - determines the observed energy dissipation between two points (typically buoys) by comparing the energy fluxes at the two points
* meanangle.m - (used once within NC_ObsDiss.m) calculates the mean of a set of angles (in degrees) based on polar considerations (Written by J.A. Dunne, 10-20-05)

## Other
* Ex_DissFunctions.m - an example script to show how NC_NeilsonDiss.m and NC_ObsDiss.m can be used and what the expected outcomes can be
* ExData_DissFunctions.mat - the sample data (very simple) that is used in the above example script
