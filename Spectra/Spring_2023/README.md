## ROXSI Wave Spectra (Spring 2024)
**Codes from Noah Clark to calculate wave characteristics based on wave buoy measurements from Spring 2024**
**January 2024 - May 2024**

### Plotting
* **plot_ErrBarAvgSpecs.m** - Determine 3 time periods of 1 day and 15 hours where there is only a peak in energy in the sea band, swell band, and where there is a peak at both bands. Plot the energy, wave direction, and directional spread during these times with a std envelope over each.
* **plot_EFraction.m** - Calculate and plot the fraction of total energy that is found at each day in the sea and swell bands. This is done only for buoy B03.
* **plot_DailySumSeaSwell.m** - Create 2 figures with 3 subplots each. One of the plots is the total energy, another the average direction, and another the average directional spread in the sea band per day for each of the 3 buoys. The other figure has the same 3 subplots but for the swell band.

### Calculating
* **calc_ShoalCoeff.m** - Calculate the shoaling coefficients between the instruments by E1/E2 and compare it against the shoaling coefficients using sqrt(Cg2/Cg1) at three time periods. Those time periods were determined by isolating 3 24 hour periods where the energy was either mostly from the Sea, the Swell, or the energy was consisted of a mix similar to the entire time average

### Functions
* **bgpatch2.m** - Dr. Suandaâ€™s function to plot an envelope of standard deviation around a series of means
* **meanangle.m** - Determines the average angle of the inputted angles. Downloaded from internet. Can input either a vector or a matrix
* **LDR.m** - Calculates an accurate estimate of only the wavelength and wave number (same as function_wavecalculateSI.m)

### Data
* **WBvariables.mat** - All of the calculated buoy data. All of data was calculated during the summer.
* **3Periods.mat** - Data calculated from script calc_ShoalCoeff.m. Data from the three selected days of where the energy was either mostly from the Sea, the Swell, or the day where the energy was consisted of a mix similar to the entire time average.
* **SM&ADCP_All.mat** - All of the data provided to me from the ADCPs and smart moorings.
* **TED.mat** - Data of the observed and Nielsen energy dissipated between all of the buoys/ADCPs at China Rock and Asilomar.
