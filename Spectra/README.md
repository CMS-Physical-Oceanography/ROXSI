## ROXSI Wave Spectra
**Codes from Noah Clark to calculate wave characteristics based on wave buoy measurements**

* Start.m - script with everything through 6/12

### Plotting
* plot_Spectro.m - makes spectrogram plots for all 6 wave buoys

### Functions
* NormDir.m - calculates what incoming wave angle will be normal to the shore in Monterey Bay, California
* wavecalculateSI.m - calculates the wavelength, wave number, and celerity 

### Loading
* load_WBdata.m - takes the spotter/wave buoy data sets and breaks them into their variables
